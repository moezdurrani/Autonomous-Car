In our project, I led a team of three to design and 3D print a customized chassis for a remote-controlled vehicle. This chassis was uniquely designed for sensor integration, enabling the vehicle to complete a track in less than two minutes. We also integrated Arduino algorithms and ultrasonic sensors, which empowered the vehicle with autonomous navigation and obstacle detection capabilities. This innovation proved highly effective in exploring challenging terrains, achieving a 94% success rate. Additionally, we engineered a dart-projectile mechanism powered by isopropyl alcohol combustion, capable of hitting a target with 88% accuracy. This comprehensive approach not only showcased our technical skills but also our ability to solve complex problems with innovative solutions.
